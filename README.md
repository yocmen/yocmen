I'm currently working on the building of an e-commerce/e-learning platform using ReactJS with GatsbyJS for the frontend and serverless/lambda function for the APIâ€™s using NodeJS, optimizing assets is a key part in e-commerce becoming fundamental on mobile devices, using serverless technology and different services including CDN we manage to bring the fastest response to our users, PayPal and Stripe are our choices to process all our payments.
