### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yocsel Mendoza, a software engineer with a passion for building web applications that are optimized for performance and user experience. Currently, I'm working at [Workvivo](https://workvivo.com/) as a software engineer, where I'm responsible for developing and maintaining the platform's frontend and backend components.

In the past, I worked on vtutor.com, an e-commerce/e-learning platform that utilized ReactJS and GatsbyJS for the frontend and serverless functions, Lambda, and NodeJS for the APIs. For vtutor.com, I focused heavily on asset optimization to provide the fastest response to our users, especially on mobile devices. By leveraging serverless technology and various services, including a Content Delivery Network (CDN), we were able to deliver exceptional performance to our users. Additionally, I was responsible for integrating PayPal and Stripe as our payment processors.
